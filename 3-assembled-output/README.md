# Assembled output for the NES version of Elite

This folder contains the output binaries from the build process for the NES version of Elite.

It also contains [compile.txt](compile.txt) and [compile0.txt](compile0.txt) through [compile7.txt](compile7.txt), which contain the output from the assembly process (for the header and banks 0 to 7 respectively). This is very useful when debugging the build process.

---

Right on, Commanders!
