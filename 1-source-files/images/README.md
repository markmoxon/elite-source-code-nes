# Image binaries for the NES version of Elite

This folder contains the image binaries for the NES version of Elite. They have been extracted from the game binaries on Ian Bell's personal website, and unpacked into binary files (which is what the game works with) and PNGs (which are viewable for humans). They are not currently used in the build process.

The [unpack.py](../../2-build-files/unpack.py) extraction script can be found in the [2-build-files](../../2-build-files) folder.

Right on, Commanders!
