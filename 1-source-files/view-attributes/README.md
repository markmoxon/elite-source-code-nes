# View attribute data for the NES version of Elite

This folder contains PPU attribute data for the 24 view types supported by the NES version of Elite. They have been extracted from the game binaries on Ian Bell's personal website, and unpacked into binary files. They are not currently used in the build process.

The original packed data can be found in the bank 3 source at the labels viewAttributes0, viewAttributes1 and so on.

The [unpack-data.py](../../2-build-files/unpack-data.py) scripts can be found in the [2-build-files](../../2-build-files) folder.

Right on, Commanders!
