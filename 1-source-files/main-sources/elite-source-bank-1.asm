\    Summary: The MMC1 mapper reset routine at the start of the ROM bank
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ When the NES is switched on, it is hardwired to perform a JMP (&FFFC). At this
\ point, there is no guarantee as to which ROM banks are mapped to &8000 and
\ &C000, so to ensure that the game starts up correctly, we put the same code
\ in each ROM at the following locations:
\
\   * We put &C000 in address &FFFC in every ROM bank, so the NES always jumps
\     to &C000 when it starts up via the JMP (&FFFC), irrespective of which
\     ROM bank is mapped to &C000.
\
\   * We put the same RESET routine at the start of every ROM bank, so the same
\     routine gets run, whichever ROM bank is mapped to &C000.
\
\ This RESET routine is therefore called when the NES starts up, whatever the
\ bank configuration ends up being. It then switches ROM bank 7 to &C000 and
\ jumps into bank 7 at the game's entry point S%, which starts the game.

                        \     below, i.e. the high byte of S%, which is &C0

\    Summary: Ship blueprints default NEWB flags
\  Deep dive: Ship blueprints
\             Advanced tactics with the NEWB flags
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ When spawning a new ship, the bits from this table are applied to the new
\ ship's NEWB flags in byte #36 (i.e. a set bit in this table will set that bit
\ in the NEWB flags). In other words, if a ship blueprint is set to one of the
\ following, then all spawned ships of that type will be too: trader, bounty
\ hunter, hostile, pirate, innocent, cop.
\
\ The NEWB flags are as follows:
\
\    * Bit 0: Trader flag (0 = not a trader, 1 = trader)
\    * Bit 1: Bounty hunter flag (0 = not a bounty hunter, 1 = bounty hunter)
\    * Bit 2: Hostile flag (0 = not hostile, 1 = hostile)
\    * Bit 3: Pirate flag (0 = not a pirate, 1 = pirate)
\    * Bit 4: Docking flag (0 = not docking, 1 = docking)
\    * Bit 5: Innocent bystander (0 = normal, 1 = innocent bystander)
\    * Bit 6: Cop flag (0 = not a cop, 1 = cop)
\    * Bit 7: For spawned ships: ship been scooped or has docked
\             For blueprints: this ship type has an escape pod fitted
\
\ See the deep dive on "Advanced tactics with the NEWB flags" for details of
\ how this works.

\ This figure contains the fractional part of the points that are added to the

\       Type: Subroutine

\  Deep dive: Line-clipping
\             Extended screen coordinates
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine clips the line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) so it fits on-screen, or
\ returns an error if it can't be clipped to fit. The arguments are 16-bit
\ coordinates, and the clipped line is returned using 8-bit screen coordinates.
\
\ This part sets XX13 to reflect which of the two points are on-screen and
\ off-screen.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   XX15(1 0)           x1 as a 16-bit coordinate (x1_hi x1_lo)
\
\   XX15(3 2)           y1 as a 16-bit coordinate (y1_hi y1_lo)
\
\   XX15(5 4)           x2 as a 16-bit coordinate (x2_hi x2_lo)
\
\   XX12(1 0)           y2 as a 16-bit coordinate (y2_hi y2_lo)
\
\ Returns:
\
\   (X1, Y1)            Screen coordinate of the start of the clipped line
\
\   (X2, Y2)            Screen coordinate of the end of the clipped line
\
\   C flag              Clear if the clipped line fits on-screen, set if it
\                       doesn't
\
\   XX13                The state of the original coordinates on-screen:
\
\                         * 0   = (x2, y2) on-screen
\
\                         * 95  = (x1, y1) on-screen,  (x2, y2) off-screen
\
\                         * 191 = (x1, y1) off-screen, (x2, y2) off-screen
\
\                       So XX13 is non-zero if the end of the line was clipped,
\                       meaning the next line sent to BLINE can't join onto the
\                       end but has to start a new segment
\
\   SWAP                The swap status of the returned coordinates:
\
\                         * &FF if we swapped the values of (x1, y1) and
\                           (x2, y2) as part of the clipping process
\
\                         * 0 if the coordinates are still in the same order
\
\   Y                   Y is preserved

\    Summary: Calculate (Y A) = nosev_x / z
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following division of a specified value from one of the
\ orientation vectors (in this example, nosev_x):
\
\   (Y A) = nosev_x / z
\
\ where z is the z-coordinate of the planet from INWK. The result is an 8-bit
\ magnitude in A, with maximum value 254, and just a sign bit (bit 7) in Y.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   Determines which of the INWK orientation vectors to
\                       divide:
\
\                         * X = 9, 11, 13: divides nosev_x, nosev_y, nosev_z
\
\                         * X = 15, 17, 19: divides roofv_x, roofv_y, roofv_z
\
\                         * X = 21, 23, 25: divides sidev_x, sidev_y, sidev_z
\
\   INWK                The planet's ship data block
\
\ Returns:
\
\   A                   The result as an 8-bit magnitude with maximum value 254
\
\   Y                   The sign of the result in bit 7
\
\   K+3                 Also the sign of the result in bit 7
\
\   X                   X gets incremented by 2 so it points to the next

\    Summary: Draw an ellipse or half-ellipse
\  Deep dive: Drawing ellipses
\             Drawing meridians and equators
\             Drawing craters
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Draw an ellipse or half-ellipse, to be used for the planet's equator and
\ meridian (in which case we draw half an ellipse), or crater (in which case we
\ draw a full ellipse).
\
\ The ellipse is defined by a centre point, plus two conjugate radius vectors,
\ u and v, where:
\
\   u = [ u_x ]       v = [ v_x ]
\       [ u_y ]           [ v_y ]
\
\ The individual components of these 2D vectors (i.e. u_x, u_y etc.) are 16-bit
\ sign-magnitude numbers, where the high bytes contain only the sign bit (in
\ bit 7), with bits 0 to 6 being clear. This means that as we store u_x as
\ (XX16 K2), for example, we know that |u_x| = K2.
\
\ This routine calls BLINE to draw each line segment in the ellipse, passing the
\ coordinates as follows:
\
\   K6(1 0) = K3(1 0) + u_x * cos(CNT2) + v_x * sin(CNT2)
\
\   K6(3 2) = K4(1 0) - u_y * cos(CNT2) - v_y * sin(CNT2)
\
\ The y-coordinates are negated because BLINE expects pixel coordinates but the
\ u and v vectors are extracted from the orientation vector. The y-axis runs
\ in the opposite direction in 3D space to that on the screen, so we need to
\ negate the 3D space coordinates before we can combine them with the ellipse's
\ centre coordinates.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   K(1 0)              The planet's radius
\
\   K3(1 0)             The pixel x-coordinate of the centre of the ellipse
\
\   K4(1 0)             The pixel y-coordinate of the centre of the ellipse
\
\   (XX16 K2)           The x-component of u (i.e. u_x), where XX16 contains
\                       just the sign of the sign-magnitude number
\
\   (XX16+1 K2+1)       The y-component of u (i.e. u_y), where XX16+1 contains
\                       just the sign of the sign-magnitude number
\
\   (XX16+2 K2+2)       The x-component of v (i.e. v_x), where XX16+2 contains
\                       just the sign of the sign-magnitude number
\
\   (XX16+3 K2+3)       The y-component of v (i.e. v_y), where XX16+3 contains
\                       just the sign of the sign-magnitude number
\
\   TGT                 The number of segments to draw:
\
\                         * 32 for a half ellipse (a meridian)
\
\                         * 64 for a full ellipse (a crater)

\       Name: SUN (Part 3 of 4)
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing suns
\    Summary: Draw the sun: Continue to move up the screen, drawing the new sun
\  Deep dive: Drawing the sun
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This part draws the new sun. By the time we get to this point, the following
\ variables should have been set up by parts 1 and 2:
\
\   V                   As we draw lines for the new sun, V contains the
\                       vertical distance between the line we're drawing and the
\                       centre of the new sun. As we draw lines and move up the
\                       screen, we either decrement (bottom half) or increment
\                       (top half) this value. See the deep dive on "Drawing the
\                       sun" to see a diagram that shows V in action
\
\   V+1                 This determines which half of the new sun we are drawing
\                       as we work our way up the screen, line by line:
\
\                         * 0 means we are drawing the bottom half, so the lines
\                           get wider as we work our way up towards the centre,
\                           at which point we will move into the top half, and
\                           V+1 will switch to &FF
\
\                         * &FF means we are drawing the top half, so the lines
\                           get smaller as we work our way up, away from the
\                           centre
\
\   TGT                 The maximum y-coordinate of the new sun on-screen (i.e.
\                       the screen y-coordinate of the bottom row of the new
\                       sun)
\
\   CNT                 The fringe size of the new sun
\
\   K2(1 0)             The new sun's radius squared, i.e. K^2
\
\   Y                   The y-coordinate of the bottom row of the new sun

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following, with X determining the vector to use:
\
\   (Y A P) = 222 * roofv_x / z
\
\ though in reality only (Y A) is used.
\
\ Although the code below supports a range of values of X, in practice the
\ routine is only called with X = 15, and then again after X has been
\ incremented to 17. So the values calculated by PLS1 use roofv_x first, then
\ roofv_y. The comments below refer to roofv_x, for the first call.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   Determines which of the INWK orientation vectors to
\                       divide:

\

\
\ Returns:
\
\   X                   X gets incremented by 2 so it points to the next
\                       coordinate in this orientation vector (so consecutive

\   Category: Stardust
\    Summary: Process the stardust for the rear view
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is very similar to STARS1, which processes stardust for the front
\ view. The main difference is that the direction of travel is reversed, so the
\ signs in the calculations are different, as well as the order of the first
\ batch of calculations.
\
\ When a stardust particle falls away into the far distance, it is removed from
\ the screen and its memory is recycled as a new particle, positioned randomly
\ along one of the four edges of the screen.
\
\ These are the calculations referred to in the commentary:
\
\   1. q = 64 * speed / z_hi
\   2. z = z - speed * 64
\   3. y = y + |y_hi| * q
\   4. x = x + |x_hi| * q
\
\   5. y = y + alpha * x / 256
\   6. x = x - alpha * y / 256
\
\   7. x = x + 2 * (beta * y / 256) ^ 2
\   8. y = y - beta * 256
\
\ For more information see the deep dive on "Stardust in the front view".

\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Stardust
\    Summary: Process the stardust for the left or right view
\  Deep dive: Stardust in the side views
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This moves the stardust sideways according to our speed and which side we are
\ looking out of, and applies our current pitch and roll to each particle of
\ dust, so the stardust moves correctly when we steer our ship.
\
\ These are the calculations referred to in the commentary:
\
\   1. delta_x = 8 * 256 * speed / z_hi
\   2. x = x + delta_x
\
\   3. x = x + beta * y
\   4. y = y - beta * x
\
\   5. x = x - alpha * x * y
\   6. y = y + alpha * y * y + alpha
\
\ For more information see the deep dive on "Stardust in the side views".

\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The view to process:

\    Summary: Ship hangar group table
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This table contains groups of ships to show in the ship hangar. A group of
\ ships is shown half the time (the other half shows a solo ship), and each of
\ the four groups is equally likely.
\
\ The bytes for each ship in the group contain the following information:
\
\   Byte #0             Non-zero = Ship type to draw
\                       0        = don't draw anything
\
\   Byte #1             Bits 0-7 = Ship's x_hi
\                       Bit 0    = Ship's z_hi (1 if clear, or 2 if set)
\
\   Byte #2             Bits 0-7 = Ship's z_lo
\                       Bit 0    = Ship's x_sign
\
\ Ths ship's y-coordinate is calculated in the has1 routine from the size of
\ its targetable area. Ships of type 0 are not shown.

\  Deep dive: Tidying orthonormal vectors
\             Orientation vectors
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine orthonormalises the orientation vectors for a ship. This means
\ making the three orientation vectors orthogonal (perpendicular to each other),
\ and normal (so each of the vectors has length 1).
\
\ We do this because we use the small angle approximation to rotate these
\ vectors in space. It is not completely accurate, so the three vectors tend
\ to get stretched over time, so periodically we tidy the vectors with this
\ routine to ensure they remain as orthonormal as possible.
